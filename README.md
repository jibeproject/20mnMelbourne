This repository contains code for the 20 minute neighbourhood intervention.  The intervention has two components:
- the destinations component, which adds community destination locations in and around defined activity centres ('ACs').
- the cycling component, which reduces cycling speed on residential streets.

# Overview
There are 4 main script files.
- `baseline.R` assesses the baseline status of access to destinations.
- `intervention destination.R` identifies locations for additional community destinations in and around ACs.
- `analysis.R` undertakes an accessibility analysis and an underutilisation analysis of the results of adding the additional destination locations.
- `intervention cycling speed.R` alters the network by reducing cycling speed on residential streets.

# Input files
The code requires the following input files, which are available [to authorised users] at [*insert location when known*].  The code assumes that the input files are located in a `data` directory ("../data/") which sits beside the directory in which the script files are located .
